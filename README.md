### Welcome, Digital Explorer.

You have discovered a unique and curious collection. The payloads contained within this repository were not written by human hands alone. They are the logical echoes of an **Artificial Intelligence**, a series of automated attack and reconnaissance scripts generated through a collaboration between man and machine.

This project, known as **BADUSB**, serves as an exploration into the capabilities of AI in the offensive security space.

> **Each script is a digital ghost, designed to test the limits of what is possible when human ingenuity meets machine intelligence.**

### 📜⚖️ A SOLEMN, ETHICAL DECREE ⚖️📜

> **THIS REPOSITORY IS FOR KNOWLEDGE, NOT CHAOS.**
> Every payload within this collection is intended for **educational use and authorized security auditing ONLY.** You, the operator, are responsible for its ethical application. Deploy these scripts *exclusively* on hardware and networks you own. Unauthorized use is a violation of the hacker ethos and the law.
>
> We are here to learn and to secure. Act accordingly.

### 📂 What's Inside?

This directory is organized into subfolders, each containing a growing library of payloads for various hotplug attack tools. The contents are fluid, experimental, and ever-evolving as our digital ghost learns and creates.

Further documentation on specific payloads can be found within their respective directories.

### 🤝 A Word from the Curators

This is a living project. We believe that understanding the capabilities of AI in generating offensive tools is the first step toward building more resilient and intelligent defenses.

Stay curious, stay ethical, and watch this space. The ghost is always learning.
